BrickHack 8 Project!

Welcome to my Github Project Repo which contains files that I have submitted for BrickHack 8(and potentially win a prize)

It is a simple website design to simulate a new product launch so I have used the coronousa.com website as a base and inspiration to begin working on my own website

Hope you like what you see and Happy Hacking!
