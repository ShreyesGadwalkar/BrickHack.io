BrickHack 8 Project!

Welcome to my Github Project Repo which contains files that I have submitted for BrickHack 8 (and potentially win a prize). I worked on this alongside my partner Jaden (GitHub username - Stormkiller-01).

It is a simple website design to simulate a new product launch so I have used the coronousa.com website as a base and inspiration to begin working on my own website.

Hope you like what you see and Happy Hacking!
